Seminar project for subject [https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/course/63527](Interaction and information design (FRI ULJ)).

## What is klecksography?
Klecksography is the art of creating mirror images using paper and ink. This technique was first used by Justinus Kerner, who incorporated the technique of klecksography into his poetry collections. The most famous user of this technique is certainly Hermann Rorschach, who created the so-called "inkblots", which he used to understand the state of an individual's psychological structure. Since the 1990s, psychologists have been using klecksography as a tool to study the subconscious.

## How this aplication works?
I designed this project as a web application, which means that the user does not have to install programs or download startup files, but the application can be easily accessed only via a URL link. The application is served by the server and then the application runs inside the web browser. This has several advantages, as the application can be changed in one place (on the server) and this change is then seen immediately after reloading the application. The application is designed as simply and as clearly as possible, so that the user understands what is happening as soon as possible. Because the app is designed to be set up in a gallery as an interactive (generative) art, it is designed to be operated without a keyboard and mouse, just via a camera with hand gestures.
